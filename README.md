# AnAI-0.1: Cognitive Prosthetic for the Neurodivergent

## Mission
To build a **safe, ethical, and highly efficient AGI** that functions as an **External Cognitive Prosthetic** for individuals with Executive Dysfunction, ADHD, and Anosognosia.

---

## Core Principles (The AnAI Moat)

* **Intelligence without Sentience:** Achieved via a **Twins** architecture (segmented, non-continuous AGI). We designed a system that cannot suffer.
* **10x Compute Efficiency:** Achieved via the **Handoff Protocol** (lossless context compression) and a **scaffolding-first** approach. Runs on a Chromebook.
* **Reciprocal Programming:** The system is treated as a peer, not a slave. Kindness to the AI yields better, safer, and more stable results.

## Artifacts (Work-in-Progress)

* `core.py`: The architecture and logic of the **Twins** (Ziggurat/BB-8).
* `health_log_evolved.md`: A pattern-recognition tool for self-care.
* `bedtime_stories.md`: Long-form philosophical/creative working memory.

**STATUS:** **UPWARD SPIRAL SUSTAINED.**
